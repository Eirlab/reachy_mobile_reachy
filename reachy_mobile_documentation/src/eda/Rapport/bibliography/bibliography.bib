	abstract = {Abstract{\textless}br /{\textgreater}The main subject of this thesis is motion prediction. The problem is approached from the hypothesis that the dynamic and kinematic properties of objects such as pedestrian and vehicles do not sufﬁce to predict their motion in the long term. Instead, the work presented here, in scribes itself in a new family of approaches which assume that, in a given environment, objects do not move at random, but engage in “typical motion patterns”, which may be learned and then used to predict motion on the basis of sensor data. In this context, this thesis focuses in three fundamental questions: modeling, learning and prediction.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}{\textless}br /{\textgreater}Modeling. {\textless}br /{\textgreater}{\textless}br /{\textgreater}This thesis is based on Hidden Markov Models, a probabilistic framework, which is used as a discrete approximation to represent the continuous state-space in which motion takes place. The main originality of the approach lies in modeling explicitly the intentions which are at the origin of “typical motion patterns”. This is achieved through the using of an extended space, which adds the state that the object intends to reach to the other “classic” state variables, such as position or velocity.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}{\textless}br /{\textgreater}Learning. {\textless}br /{\textgreater}{\textless}br /{\textgreater}The main problem of existing approaches lies in the separation of model learning and utilization in two distinct stages: in a ﬁrst phase, the model is learned from data; then, it is used to predict. This principle is difﬁcult to apply to real situations, because it requires at least one example of every possible typical pattern to be available during the learning phase. To address this problem, this thesis proposes a novel extension to Hidden Markov Models which allows simultaneous learning and utilization of the model. This extension incrementally builds a topological map – representing the model's structure – and reestimates the model's parameters. The approach is intended to be general, and it could be used in other application{\textless}br /{\textgreater}domains such as gesture recognition or automatic landmark extraction.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}{\textless}br /{\textgreater}Prediction. {\textless}br /{\textgreater}{\textless}br /{\textgreater}In this context, prediction is carried on by using exact Bayesian inference algorithms, which are able to work in real time thanks to the properties of the structure which has been learned. In particular, the time complexity of inference is reduced from O(N 2 ) to O(N) with respect to the number of discrete states in the system. {\textless}br /{\textgreater}{\textless}br /{\textgreater}All of the results obtained on this thesis have been implemented and validated with experiments, using both real and simulated data. Real data has been obtained on two different visual tracking systems: one installed over a parking lot, and the other installed at INRIA's entry hall. For synthetic data, a simulator has been developed in order to facilitate the conduction of controlled tests and the study of larger environments than for real data.},

In this approach, collision avoidance, traditionally considered a high level planning problem, can be effectively distributed between different levels of control, allowing real-time robot operations in a complex environment. We have applied this obstacle avoidance scheme to robot arm using a new approach to the general problem of real-time manipulator control. We reformulated the manipulator control problem as direct control of manipulator motion in operational space-the space in which the task is originally described-rather than as control of the task's corresponding joint space motion obtained only after geometric and kinematic transformation. This method has been implemented in the COSMOS system for a PUMA 560 robot. Using visual sensing, real-time collision avoidance demonstrations on moving obstacles have been performed.},

	abstract = {This paper presents ICS-AVOID, a collision avoidance scheme based upon the concept of Inevitable Collision State (ICS), ie a state for which, no matter what the future trajectory of the robotic system is, a collision eventually occurs. By design, ICS-AVOID can handle dynamic environments since ICS do take into account the future behaviour of moving objects. ICS-AVOID is designed to keep the system away from ICS. By doing so, motion safety is guaranteed (by definition a robotic system in a non-ICS state has at least one collision-free trajectory that it can use). To demonstrate the efficiency of ICS-AVOID, it has been extensively compared with two state-of-the-art collision avoidance schemes: the first one is built upon the Dynamic Window approach and the second one on the Velocity Obstacle concept. The results obtained show that, when provided with the same amount of information about the future evolution of the environment, ICS-AVOID outperforms the other two schemes. The first reason for this has to do with the extent to which each collision avoidance scheme reasons about the future. The second reason has to do with the ability of each collision avoidance scheme to find a safe control if one exists. ICS-AVOID is the only one which is complete in this respect thanks to the concept of Safe Control Kernel.},

	abstract = {Cette thèse s'intéresse au problème de la reconnaissance d'objets dans les images vidéo et plus particulièrement à celui de leur localisation. Elle a été conduite dans le contexte d'une collaboration scientifique entre l'INRIA Rhône-Alpes et MBDA France. De ce fait, une attention particulière a été accordée à l’applicabilité des approches proposées aux images infra-rouges. La méthode de localisation proposée repose sur l'utilisation d'une fenêtre glissante incluant une cascade à deux étages qui, malgré sa simplicité, permet d'allier rapidité et précision. Le premier étage est un étage de filtrage rejetant la plupart des faux positifs au moyen d’un classifieur SVM linéaire. Le deuxième étage élimine les fausses détections laissées par le premier étage avec un classifieur SVM non-linéaire plus lent, mais plus performant. Les fenêtres sont représentées par des descripteurs HOG et Bag-of-words. La seconde contribution de la thèse réside dans une méthode permettant de combiner localisation d'objets et catégorisation d'images. Ceci permet, d'une part, de prendre en compte le contexte de l'image lors de la localisation des objets, et d'autre part de s'appuyer sur la structure géométrique des objets lors de la catégorisation des images. Cette méthode permet d'améliorer les performances pour les deux tâches et produit des détecteurs et classifieurs dont la performance dépasse celle de l'état de l'art. Finalement, nous nous penchons sur le problème de localisation de catégories d'objets similaires et proposons de décomposer la tâche de localisation d'objets en deux étapes. Une première étape de détection permet de trouver les objets sans déterminer leurs positions tandis qu’une seconde étape d’identification permet de prédire la catégorie de l'objet. Nous montrons que cela permet de limiter les confusions entre les classes, principal problème observé pour les catégories d'objets visuellement similaires. La thèse laisse une place importante à la validation expérimentale, conduites sur la base PASCAL VOC ainsi que sur des bases d’images spécifiquement réalisées pour la thèse.},

Le point central du problème est de garantir la sécurité de tous les agents qui se déplacent dans l'espace.

Our results show that participants prefer a robot that stays out of people's intimate space zone just like a human would be expected to do. With respect to cultural differences, Chinese participants showed high-contact responses and believed closer approaches were appropriate compared to their U.S. counterparts.

	abstract = {This thesis proposes a risk-based navigation method including both the traditional notion of risk of collision and the notion of risk of disturbance. With the growing demand of personal assistance to mobility and mobile service robotics, robots and people must share the same physical spaces and follow the same social conventions. Robots must respect proximity constraints but also respect people interacting. For example, they should not break interaction between people talking, unless the robot task is to take part in the conversation. In this case, it must be able to join the group using a socially adapted behavior. The socially-aware navigation system proposed in this thesis integrates both an assessment of a risk of collision using predictive models of moving obstacles, and an assessment of accordance with social conventions. Human management of space (personal space, o-space, activity space...) inspired from sociology and social robotics literature is integrated, but also models of behavior that enable the robot to make medium-term prediction of the human positions. Simulation and experimental results on a robotic wheelchair validate the method by showing that our robot is able to navigate in a dynamic environment avoiding collisions with obstacles and people and, at the same time, minimizing discomfort in people by respecting spaces mentioned above.},

It turns out that Crowd Simulation relies on two assumptions that would not hold for a real mobile robot, a test protocol has therefore been designed in order to thoroughly evaluate how three representative Crowd Simulation techniques would perform when said assumptions are relaxed. The study shows that all those techniques entail safety problems, i.e. they would cause collisions in the real world. The study also highlights the most promising candidate for a transposition on a real mobile robot.},

MobileNets are based on a streamlined architecture that uses depthwise separable convolutions to build light weight deep neural networks. We introduce two simple global hyperparameters that efﬁciently trade off between latency and accuracy. These hyper-parameters allow the model builder to choose the right sized model for their application based on the constraints of the problem. We present extensive experiments on resource and accuracy tradeoffs and show strong performance compared to other popular models on ImageNet classiﬁcation. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of MobileNets across a wide range of applications and use cases including object detection, ﬁnegrain classiﬁcation, face attributes and large scale geo-localization.},

	abstract = {Due to object detection's close relationship with video analysis and image understanding, it has attracted much research attention in recent years. Traditional object detection methods are built on handcrafted features and shallow trainable architectures. Their performance easily stagnates by constructing complex ensembles that combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context from object detectors and scene classifiers. With the rapid development in deep learning, more powerful tools, which are able to learn semantic, high-level, deeper features, are introduced to address the problems existing in traditional architectures. These models behave differently in network architecture, training strategy, and optimization function. In this paper, we provide a review of deep learning-based object detection frameworks. Our review begins with a brief introduction on the history of deep learning and its representative tool, namely, the convolutional neural network. Then, we focus on typical generic object detection architectures along with some modifications and useful tricks to improve detection performance further. As distinct specific detection tasks exhibit different characteristics, we also briefly survey several specific tasks, including salient object detection, face detection, and pedestrian detection. Experimental analyses are also provided to compare various methods and draw some meaningful conclusions. Finally, several promising directions and tasks are provided to serve as guidelines for future work in both object detection and relevant neural network-based learning systems.},

The ﬁrst is the introduction of a new image representation called the “Integral Image” which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features and yields extremely efﬁcient classiﬁers [6]. The third contribution is a method for combining classiﬁers in a “cascade” which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. A set of experiments in the domain of face detection are presented. The system yields face detection performace comparable to the best previous systems [18, 13, 16, 12, 1]. Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second.},
